PLACEHOLDER FILE

This is a placeholder file to ensure the certificates folder is tracked by git.

To add your certificates:
1. Place your PDF files in this folder (public/certificates/)
2. Update the certificatePdf paths in src/components/Achievements.js
3. Delete this placeholder file

Example PDF filenames:
- react-certificate.pdf
- javascript-certification.pdf
- aws-cloud-practitioner.pdf
- hackathon-winner.pdf

Remember: Use descriptive names without spaces (use hyphens or underscores instead).
